description: This indicator tracks the personal saving rate as a percentage of disposable personal income. The 'value' field represents the percentage of after-tax income that households save rather than spend. A higher savings rate indicates financial security and the ability to build wealth, while a declining rate can signal financial stress, where households must spend all or most of their income just to maintain their lifestyle. This is a key indicator of household economic health and resilience. Data is calculated monthly by the Bureau of Economic Analysis.
