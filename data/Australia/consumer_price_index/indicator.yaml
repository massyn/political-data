description: This indicator tracks the Consumer Price Index (CPI) for Australia, measuring changes in the cost of living over time. The 'value' field represents the year-over-year inflation rate as a percentage (e.g., 3.24% means prices rose 3.24% compared to the same quarter last year). The 'index' field is the absolute CPI index value using 2011-12 as the base period (100), allowing for long-term price comparisons.
