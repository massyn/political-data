description: This indicator tracks the Consumer Price Index (CPI) for South Africa, measuring changes in the cost of living over time. The 'value' field represents the year-over-year inflation rate as a percentage (e.g., 5.2% means prices rose 5.2% compared to the same quarter last year). The 'index' field is the absolute CPI index value, allowing for long-term price comparisons. Statistics South Africa (StatsSA) maintains a CPI Historical Table Archive with comprehensive historical data.
